## Technologies used

- **React.js** — A JavaScript library for building user interfaces as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications
- **React Native** — Framework to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP using React along with native platform capabilities
- **Node.js** — Runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser, allowing us to built an API for our application
- **Express** — Web framework for Node.js that is used here especially to define the routes in our application
- **Expo** - Framework built around React Native and native platforms that helps you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase
- **Knex** - JavaScript query builder for relational databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3, and Oracle

## Kicking things off

>It is necessary to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed in your machine to run this app. Note that the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) already comes with Node.js, but it is also possible to [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you prefer. As the installation depends on the OS of your computer, the best way to go about it is to follow the instructions from their official websites.

Clone this repository and access the project folder typing the following in your terminal:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/rfmiotto/be-the-hero.git
  cd be-the-hero
  ```

### Back-end initialization

Access the back-end directory and install the dependencies (substitute the `yarn` command by `npm install` if you are using npm):
  ```
  cd backend
  yarn
  ```
Then, initialize the server using
  ```
  npm start
  ```

### Using a web browser

In another terminal window, go to the front-end directory and install the dependencies:
  ```
  cd frontend
  yarn
  ```
Then, fire up the application in your web browser from terminal using:
  ```
  npm start
  ```

### Using a mobile device

In another terminal window, go to the front-end directory and install the dependencies:
  ```
  cd mobile
  yarn
  ```
Then, fire up the application from terminal using:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
In order to visualize and interact with the app, you can install an emulator in your computer or download the app *expo* in your mobile device. With expo, just read the QR code that will be displayed in your terminal.
